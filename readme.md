# TinyApp

October 2019
Graeme Nickerson

## Goal
This four-day project will have you building a web app using Node. The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

TinyApp is a HTTP Server based on the Express framework that handles requests from the browser (client).
